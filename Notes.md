# Notes For Java 8 OCA Certificaiton 

* What is Java?
    * A programming language as well as a platform.
    * As a programming language, it was designed to be:
        * simple, object-oriented, and familiar
        * robust and secure
        * architecturally neutral and portable 
            * indepedent of platform
            * 'write once, run anywhere'
        * interpreted, threaded, and dynamic
        * high performing
* The Java Platform
    * Consists of two components:
        * The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
        * The Java Application Programming Interface (API)
        * Structure:
            1. Your Java Application
                * What is distributed
            2. Java API
            3. Java Virtual Machine
            4. Hardware/OS
    * In Java, applications are both compiled and interpreted
        * The Java compiler compiles the application source code to an intermediate language that is interpreted by the JVM
        * The intermediate language is called bytecode (not machine code)
            * Bytecode is like the "machine code" for the JVM
        * Java Application -> Java Compiler -> Bytecode for the Application -> JVM -> Machine Code -> Hardware/OS
* Editions and Versions
* Java Development Kit (JDK)
